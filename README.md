# pablo.town

My personal website meant to share blog posts and informations about me, my projects and maybe more.

## Tech stack

This is a static site built with [lustre/ssg](https://github.com/lustre-labs/ssg) in [gleam](https://gleam.run). Most of the content is defined within the code, or with text/mekdown files.

The style is made in pure css

## Development

```sh
gleam run -b build   # Build the site
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
