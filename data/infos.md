Hi! Welcome to my website! Here you will find some blog posts, mostly [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) writeups, and sometime about random things I find interesting.

I'll try to add some other sections to the site, mostly fun or artistic thing. This site is not a CV or a professional website, I just want to have an independent way to share my ideas and my projects.
